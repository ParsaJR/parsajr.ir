For getting taste of Ansible, Here i try to write some ansible playbooks for common security tasks. Here are the things that i think achievable with ansible:

1. Copy our ssh public key to all the remote servers, so we can connect to all servers without using password login
2. security updates
3. disabling password login
4. Firewall configuration
5. Changing the ssh port from 22 to something else. humans are smart enough to find that, we're doing this only for getting rid of some robots that are wandering the internet for finding insecure servers.(I know, some robots are also not that dumb but anyway)

Let's Go!

## SSH public key

## Security update

## Password login

## Firewall

## SSH port

## Wrap up

As you seen, Ansible has a really important place for automation In devops tool era. It's performant and ergonomic for writing common tasks. But as a downside, it's tedious to write and test properly. And also playbooks can become nasty for some tricky tasks like changing the ssh port and etc. Anyway, i'm happy with that.
