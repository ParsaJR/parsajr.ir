# What is Nuxt Content?

**Content** is a Nuxt module that helps you to work with markdowns easily.
Nuxt Content reads the '/content' directory in your project, parses them to create 
a powerful data layer for nuxt application! <br>

Let's see what it can do for us in more details :rocket:

## Parse Markdowns

Obivesly it can parse Markdown files to HTML tags! <br>
(this whole page you see is actually built upon this!) <br>
and because of this, you inherit all of the basic markdown capabilities.
 for example: <br>
 
 **Bold text** <br>
 *Italic text* <br>
 > Quoting text

and etc...


## Code Highlighting

you can render codeblocks in you Markdowns with beautiful syntax highliting. 

Example:
```ts
export default {
 itsAwesome: true
}
```
this is made possible using [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) under the hood.
it has so many themes that you can choose. that one i have used is called **github-dark**.

## Vue Components Inside Markdowns

Create Vue Components inside `/components/content`, then you can use them in markdowns!

Example:
```vue
<!-- Alert.vue -->
<template>
    <div role="alert" class="rounded border-s-4 border-red-500 bg-red-50 p-4 dark:border-red-600 dark:bg-red-900">
        <strong class="block font-medium text-red-800 dark:text-red-100"> Alert </strong>

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-red-700 dark:text-red-200">
            <slot></slot> 
            <!-- the slot tag is recieve our value from markdown -->
        </p>
    </div>
</template>
```

then, use it in Markdowns like this: 

```md
::alert
The content of the card
::
```

Output: 


::alert
The content of the card
::

Cool!

## Query on your data

Content module provides some Composables that can do various things for us. One of them is `queryContent()`. <br>

The `queryContent` composable provides methods for querying and fetching your contents. <br>
Example:

```vue
<script setup>
const { data } = await useAsyncData('home', () => queryContent('/').findOne())
</script>

<template>
  <pre>
    {{ data }}
  </pre>
</template>
```

Here we use queryContent Composable to fetch single document that exists in `/` ( slash '/' means `/content` folder in this context)

## Render markdowns in page

Content module provides some Components that can do various things for us. One of them is `<ContentRenderer>`. <br>
The `<ContentRenderer>` component renders a document coming from a query with `queryContent()`. <br>
We pass the data to the component and it renders. 
Look at the example below: 

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await useAsyncData('page-data', () => queryContent('/hello').findOne())
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    Parse & render markdown  fetched
    <ContentRenderer :value="data"> 
      <template #empty>
        <p>No content found.</p>
      </template>
    </ContentRenderer>
  </main>
</template>
```
