So it goes like this:

First: You should look for some screenshot tool that let you control it's behavior using command-line.

One good solution can be **gnome-screenshot**.

Chances are it has already been installed if you are using an Ubuntu-based distribution like Linux Mint. If not, you can install it:

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-screenshot
```

After that, simply add a keybinding to your i3 configuration with your desired options:

```bash
bindsym Print exec "gnome-screenshot -ac"
```

Take a look at `man gnome-screeshot` for more option.
