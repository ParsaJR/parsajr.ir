The only productivity hack that i found useful is:

__Having a unintrupped time in working flow.__

It can be expanded to any other activity as well as formal working hours. Whether it's
`Lifting some weights in GYM` or `Reading an interesting book` or even
`spending your time with a person that you care about`.

Ask yourself: When was the last time you had three or even four completely
uninterrupted hours to yourself and your work?

Mayble it depends on the kind of work that you do, But uninterrupted time is
the single best thing for quality output and genuine enjoyment that
i found; for almost anything.

Anything more than that, feels like an efficiency
trap.

That's it.
